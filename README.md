- Copy the template below into your newly created file
- Update the content
- Add any image files to main-content/blog-images/
- Make sure that image1, image2, image3 are set to the location of your image ("../../../main-content/blog-images/YOUR_IMAGE_NAME)
- Check that it works locally if you desire

## Quick Notes 
- There cannot be carriage returns in the content sections, if you want to add newlines they must be encoded as \n
- The name of the file must follow this format 2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md -- which is date-title
